<!---A paragraph about why you wanted to take this class and any web programming and/or software development skills you already have.-->

<div class ="paragraph_header" >
<p>I designed basic websites in the past and decided to join this class to enhance, or work more on, my backend web knowledge.  For now, my skills set includes CSS , HTML, a bit of php and Javascript. I use php mostly for contact pages and then javascript for website interaction. I am still learning and excited to advance my skills. As that will help with adding more interaction and creativeness. In my current work I use Python and starting to get into SQL. </p>

<span>is definitely a place someone new to New York and lover of Ramen should try. The customer service and is great with a short wait time. I tried a few places in NYC and so far this restuarant in my eyes have the best broth. The plating size was good for me as I was extremly full towards the end. </span>
